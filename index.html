            <p>Pikachu are small, chubby, and cute mouse-like Pokémon. They are almost completely covered by yellow fur.
                They have long yellow ears that are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its
                large tail is notable for being shaped like a lightning bolt. On its cheeks are two circle-shaped red
                pouches used for storing electricity. They turn yellow and spark with electricity when it's about to use
                an Electric attack, such as Thunderbolt. It has also been known to generate small surges of electrical
                energy in anger or for protection.</p>
            <p>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon which was introduced in Generation I. It is the Version Mascot and
                Starter Pokémon for the game Pokémon Yellow and its remake, Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! It evolves from
                Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. When
                in Alola, it evolves into Alolan Raichu. It also has a Gigantamax form, and can be found in Cramorant's
                Gorging Form.</p>
            <p>Pikachu is considered as the main Pokémon in the anime as it is the starter of Ash. Ash received Pikachu
                in "Pokémon - I Choose You!". Then, Ash's rival, Ritchie, owned a Pikachu named Sparky. In "The Climb to
                Be the Very Best!", it was revealed that Ash's Pikachu can Gigantamax.</p>
